# RandomForest_APP
Streamlit application for predicting cardiovascular disease risk using Supervised Machine Learning - Random Forest Classification Model.

1. In the file `Proyecto Trees Ensemble.ipynb`, you will find the hyperparameter tuning process for three models: DecisionTree, RandomForest and XGBoost. Additionally, the notebook includes an evaluation to determine which model performs best. 
2. In the file `app.py` you can find the code used to deploy the algorithm in Streamlit.

3. You can find the deployed model in https://randomforestapp-2eyw6edp6trqe2uwtx4w6i.streamlit.app
