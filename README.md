# RandomForest_APP
Streamlit application for predicting cardiovascular disease risk using Supervised Machine Learning - Random Forest Classification Model.

1. In the file `Proyecto Trees Ensemble.ipynb`, you can find a DecisionTree, RandomForest and XGBoost hyperparameter tunning and the subsequent verification of which model performs better.
2. In the file `app.py` you can find the code used to deploy the algorithm in Streamlit.
